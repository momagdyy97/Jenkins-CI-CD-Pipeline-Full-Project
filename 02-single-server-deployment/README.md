🚀 What I’ve Achieved
CI/CD: Jenkins automatically packages and deploys your Flask app.

Remote Execution: Secure SSH with Jenkins credentials.

Post-deployment automation:

App is unpacked and placed in the correct web directory

Virtual environment is recreated cleanly

Dependencies installed

Tests run with logs preserved

Nginx restarted automatically

File permissions adjusted

✅ Next Steps (Optional Enhancements)
Here are a few ideas to take your pipeline further:

Feature	Benefit
🔍 Health Check (curl / HTTP)	Validate app is live after deployment
🔔 Slack / Email Notification	Inform team of success/failure
📄 Pipeline Artifact Archiving	Keep build logs or zipped source for rollback
🔐 Backup old deployment before overwrite	Safer rollback in case of failures
🛡️ Add firewall rules check / fail2ban	Extra layer of protection
